 * reporting and recovering assertion violations. These options are
 * arranged so that runtime subset can be easily determined. That is
 * if the run-time option is ALL but the compile-time option was
 * PRECONDITIONS_ONLY, then at run-time, only PRECONDITIONS can be
 * checked. This validity can be found out by just comparing numerical
 * values.
