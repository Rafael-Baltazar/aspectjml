/**
 * A JML exception class for notifying precondition violations.
 * The runtime assertion checker makes a distinction among precondition
 * violations: <em>internal precondition violations</em> and
 * <em>entry precondition violations</em>.
 * An internal precondition violation refers to a precondition violation
 * that arises inside the execution of the method, say <em>M</em>, that
 * we are interested in. An entry precondition violation refers to a
 * violation concerned with the method <em>M</em>'s precondition.
